This tool is designed to help users remove unwanted coupon bars and browser extensions that can clutter web browsers and impact user experience. While it aims to provide a solution for cleaning up potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), its safety can be a concern; some users have reported that it may trigger false positives in antivirus software or lead to system errors during installation or execution. Additionally, like many removal tools, its effectiveness can vary, and there is a possibility that it may not fully eliminate all traces of unwanted software, which raises questions about its reliability and overall performance.
